CONFIGURING MLX in Linux (Ubunt and mint)

This is a simple tutorial i have made from all the other tutorials i saw spread in the internet(mostly from github). With the purpose to guide through the process of working with the Minilibx library in Linux.
I took too long to have this working so i decided to create a simpler one.

1. git clone https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux

 Requirements for Linux

    MinilibX only support TrueColor visual type (8,15,16,24 or 32 bits depth)
    gcc
    make
    X11 include files (package xorg)
    XShm extension must be present (package libxext-dev)
    Utility functions from BSD systems - development files (package libbsd-dev)

2. sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libx11-dev libbsd-dev libssl-dev

3. cd minilibx-linux

4. ./configure (to run the script and create the minilibx.a(s))

    4.1 WARNING! if libraries could not be found please run this command:  - sudo apt-get install libc6-dev 

5. Run these commands: (outside of the minilbx folder)
   (this step is only required if you want to have the library always installed in your pc)

	sudo mv minilibx-linux/man/man1 /usr/local/man/
	sudo mv minilibx-linux/libmlx.a /usr/local/lib/
	sudo mv minilibx-linux/mlx.h /usr/local/include/

6. compile example 
 (clang or gcc) -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c -lbsd -lmlx -lXext -lX11

 !!you need to have already created a main.c file for this last step to work!!



 Addtional notes:

 convert .PNG to .XPM

 - sudo convert foo.jpg -geometry 320x240 -colors 216 foo.xpm

      - resolution can be of any choice (for sprites in small windows i choose 44x44)
      - color deph can be much lower at 64 instead of 216 value at least
